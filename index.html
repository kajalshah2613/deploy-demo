	<P>Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian cuisines include: gujrati, Rajasthani, Meghalayan and bengali. <br> Italian cuisine is a Mediterranean cuisine consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula. Italian cuisine is generally characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation. Ingredients and dishes vary by region. Some of the most scrumptious Italian vegetarian cuisines include four cheese pasta, grilled vegetable lasagne, bruschetta and many more. </P><br>
 
   <p>Indian cuisine offers many tasty and scrumptious options from a chickpea curry to garlic-tinged lentils to paneer cheese in a rich sauce. Vegetarian cuisine is proven by the assertive and immersed flavourâ€™s, depth of spice, and array of textures. Some beginner cooks find Indian dishes intimidating because many include a long list of spices and multiple steps. But once you gather the goods it becomes a smooth sailing to cook Indian appetising dishes. </p><br>

   <p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that India loves its pizzas, pasta and risottos, even if it means it giving the authentic Italian dishes our own desi tadka. we fall back on pastas, pizzas and risottos to satisfy our cravings for a good meal. Home-made pizzas are also a favourite option for a quick meal during game nights or family get-togethers. The main course mostly comprises of the most popular Italian recipe pasta or risotto. Fact: There are more than 600 shapes of pasta produced across the world. Bon Appetit </p>
